        <p>The goal of this thesis is to develop a self-assessment tool to efficiently predict the likelihood of anxiety,
            using a machine learning approach. The proliferation of anxiety among young adults today is a serious mental
            health concern, and existing anxiety assessment tools are either too long or not very accessible. Research
            work first need be done by applying various machine learning techniques on datasets of existing anxiety and
            mental health questionnaires, before selecting the best approach. Then, a best set of survey questions and
            machine learning models would be selected, which would accurately predict the likelihood of anxiety, based
            on how the questions were answered. Finally, a prototype of the thesis product would be implemented as a web
            application, with a web user interface that mimic the functionality of the anxiety self-assessment tool.</p>

        <p>I am in the process of publishing my thesis paper in a journal called 
            <a href="https://www.springer.com/journal/13428">Behavior Research Methods</a>. I am hoping that this will be
            a significant contribution to the field of applied psychology and survey methodology.</p>
