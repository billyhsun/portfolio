		<h1>Swimming and Lifeguarding</h1>
		<h3>City of Toronto, Earl Haig Secondary School</h3><br>

		<p>Between winter 2015 and summer 2016, I worked as a lifeguard, swim instructor, and aquatics program assistant
			for the city of Toronto. My work involved everything from ensuring pool safety to teaching city swimming
			programs.</p>

		<p>Throughout high school, I was a member of my school's swim team, winning multiple individual and team awards
			(including two-time city of Toronto champions), and serving as co-captain in the final year.</p>
