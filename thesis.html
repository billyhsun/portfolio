        <p>The goal of this thesis is to develop a self-assessment tool to efficiently predict the likelihood of anxiety,
            using a machine learning approach. The proliferation of anxiety among young adults today is a serious mental
            health concern, and existing anxiety assessment tools are either too long or not very accessible. Research
            work first need be done by applying various machine learning techniques on datasets of existing anxiety and
            mental health questionnaires, before selecting the best approach. Then, a best set of survey questions and
            machine learning models would be selected, which would accurately predict the likelihood of anxiety, based
            on how the questions were answered. Finally, a prototype of the thesis product would be implemented as a web
            application, with a web user interface that mimic the functionality of the anxiety self-assessment tool.</p>

        <p>This paper has been published in the
            <a href="https://www.springer.com/journal/13428">Behavior Research Methods</a> journal.

        <p>The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) is a test of personality and psychopathology with many 
            applications (Camara et al., 2000) such as the diagnostic and treatment of mental disorders, forensic psychology, 
            and screening in personnel selection (Butcher and Williams, 2009). It is the most widely used psychometric test in the world, 
            and its most commonly administered version, the MMPI-2, contains 567 true/false questions (Drayton, 2009). However, 
            completing the test is exhausting and time consuming due to the large number of questions. This makes the test difficult 
            and inconvenient to be taken on a regular basis or to be administered on a large scale. </p>
