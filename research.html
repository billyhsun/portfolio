        <p>The goal of this thesis is to develop a self-assessment tool to efficiently predict the likelihood of anxiety,
            using a machine learning approach. The proliferation of anxiety among young adults today is a serious mental
            health concern, and existing anxiety assessment tools are either too long or not very accessible. Research
            work first need be done by applying various machine learning techniques on datasets of existing anxiety and
            mental health questionnaires, before selecting the best approach. Then, a best set of survey questions and
            machine learning models would be selected, which would accurately predict the likelihood of anxiety, based
            on how the questions were answered. Finally, a prototype of the thesis product would be implemented as a web
            application, with a web user interface that mimic the functionality of the anxiety self-assessment tool.</p>

        <p>This paper has been published in the
            <a href="https://www.springer.com/journal/13428">Behavior Research Methods</a> journal.

        <p>This study applies a set of machine learning methods to develop a shortened MMPI-2 scale, 
            which consists of 567 items, and evaluate its validity. We first selected the most important 
            items using feature importance measures such as MRMR and SHAP, and then trained machine learning 
            models on the selected items. We employed a novel machine learning method called the stacked 
            generalization ensemble, of several machine learning techniques to achieve the above accuracy. 
            We were able to reduce the length of the MMPI-2 by over 82%. The shortened MMPI scales can measure 
            the 10 target conditions/subscales with at least 85% Area Under Curve of the Receiver Operating 
            Characteristic (AUC ROC). Finally, we implemented this shortened MMPI-2 scale into a mobile-friendly 
            web application, to demonstrate its effectiveness when using it for regular mental health monitoring 
            or screening. This shortened scale can help alleviate pressure on healthcare systems for dealing 
            with mental health concerns, as well as demonstrating a novel approach for developing cognitive tests. </p>
